    ◦ Main Website Sections/Pages: (e.g., Homepage, About Us, Services/Machines, Portfolio/Case Studies, Contact, FAQ, Blog/News).
        ▪ Note on "About Us" page: While not primarily for SEO ranking, it's essential for user experience, providing company history, team information (if available, pull headshots and bios, double-checking for accuracy), achievements, and values to build trust. Its content should align with the overall website concept.

• Role: Act as a Lead UI/UX Designer and Visual Brand Consultant.
• Task: Using the "Business Research and Core Identity Definition" from Step 1 and "Content Strategy" from Step 2, propose a cohesive visual identity for the website. Ensure no placeholders; all visual concepts should be described or given as keywords for image generation/stock photo searches. The design should be modern and professional.
• Context: Input from Step 1 and Step 2.
    ◦ Specific User Request: "No placeholders, pull hero images from URLs online, it should be modern." "Add a hero image carousel with 4 images." "Use all of the machines on the machines page, and copy all pictures and descriptions of those accurately."
